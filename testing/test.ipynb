    "While the underlying interactions of hadronic collisions and hadronisation are understood within the Standard Model, exact computation of the processes governed by QCD are difficult due to the highly non-linear nature of the strong force.  In the absence of full calculations, generators based on phenomenological models have been devised and optimised, or ``tuned'', to accurately reproduce experimental observations.  These generators predict how Standard Model physics will behave at the LHC  and constitute the reference for discoveries of New Physics effects.  \n",
    "Strange quark production is a powerful probe for hadronisation processes at  { {p-p}} colliders since protons have no net strangeness.  Recent experimental results in the field have been published by STAR ~\\cite{STAR} from RHIC   { {p-p}} collisions at  { s }  = 0.2 {  {TeV}} and by ALICE ~\\cite{ALICE}, CMS ~\\cite{CMS} and LHCb ~\\cite{KsCrossSection} from LHC   { {p-p}} collisions at  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {  {TeV}}.  LHCb  can make an important contribution thanks to a full instrumentation of the detector in the forward region that is unique among the LHC  experiments.  Studies of data recorded at different energies with the same apparatus help to control the experimental systematic uncertainties.  \n",

    "The Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment (LHCb) at CERN is a single-arm spectrometer covering the forward rapidity region.  The analysis presented in this paper relies exclusively on the tracking detectors.  The high precision tracking system begins with a silicon strip Vertex Locator (VELO), designed to identify displaced secondary vertices up to about 65 {   cm}  downstream of the nominal interaction point.  A large area silicon tracker follows upstream of a dipole magnet and tracker stations, built with a mixture of straw tube and silicon strip detectors, are located downstream.  The LHCb  coordinate system is defined to be right-handed with its origin at the nominal interaction point, the z axis aligned along the beam line towards the magnet and the y axis pointing upwards.  The bending plane is horizontal and the magnet has a reversible field, with the positive B_y polarity called ``up'' and the negative ``down''.  Tracks reconstructed through the full spectrometer experience an integrated magnetic field of around 4 Tm.  The detector is described in full elsewhere \\cite{DetectorPaper}.\n",
    "A loose minimum bias trigger is used for this analysis, requiring at least one track segment in the downstream tracking stations.  This trigger is more than 99 \\% efficient for offline selected events that contain at least two tracks reconstructed through the full system.\n",
    "Complementary data sets were recorded at two collision energies of  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {  {TeV}}, with both polarities of the dipole magnet.  An integrated luminosity of  {0.3  {nb}^{-1}}  (corresponding to 12.5 million triggers) was taken at the lower energy, of which 48 \\% had the up  magnetic field configuration.  At the higher energy, 67 \\% of a total  {1.8  {nb}^{-1}}  (110.3 million triggers) was taken with field up .\n",
    "At injection energy ( { {\\sqrts}  = 0.9  { { Te  -0.1em V}} } ), the proton beams are significantly broadened spatially compared to the accelerated beams at  { {\\sqrts}  = 7  { { Te  -0.1em V}} } .  To protect the detector, the two halves of the VELO are retracted along the x axis from their nominal position of inner radius of 8 {   mm}  to the beam, out to 18 {   mm} , which results in a reduction of the detector acceptance at small angles to the beam axis by approximately 0.5 units of rapidity.\n",
    "The beams collide with a crossing angle in the horizontal plane tuned to compensate for LHCb 's magnetic field.  The angle required varies as a function of beam configuration and for the data taking period covered by this study was set to 2.1 {   mrad}  at  { {\\sqrts}  = 0.9  { { Te  -0.1em V}} }  and 270 { { \\textmu rad}}  at 7 {  {TeV}}.  Throughout this analysis  { V ^0}   momenta and any derived quantity such as rapidity are computed in the centre-of-mass frame of the colliding protons.\n",
    "Samples of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events have been produced in close approximation to the data-taking conditions described above for estimation of efficiencies and systematic uncertainties.  A total of 73 million simulated minimum bias events were used for this analysis per magnet polarity at  { {\\sqrts}  = 0.9  { { Te  -0.1em V}} }  and 60 (69) million events at 7 {  {TeV}} for field up  (down ).

    "Particle interactions within the detector are simulated using the  { {Geant}}  package, which implements interaction cross-sections for each particle according to the LHEP physics list \\cite{Geant}.  These simulated cross-sections have been tested in the LHCb  framework and are consistent with the LHEP values.  The small measured differences are propagated to  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { {\\Lambda} }  and  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { { K } ^0_{   S}}  to estimate absolute uncertainties on the ratios of about 0.02.   { V ^0}   absorption is limited by the requirement that each  { V ^0}   decay occurs within the most upstream tracker (the VELO).  Secondary  { V ^0}   production in material is suppressed by the Fisher discriminant, which rejects  { V ^0}   candidates with large impact parameter.  The potential bias on the ratios is explored by measurement of both  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { {\\Lambda} }  and  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { { K } ^0_{   S}}  as a function of material traversed (determined by the detector simulation), in units of radiation length, X_0.   Data and simulation are compared by their ratio, shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:material-int-ratios}.  These double ratios are consistent with a flat line as a function of X_0, therefore any possible imperfections in the description of the detector material in simulation do not have a large effect on the  { V ^0}   ratios. Note that the double ratios are not expected to be unity since simulations do not predict the same values for  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { {\\Lambda} }  and  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { { K } ^0_{   S}}  as are observed in data.\n",
    "The potential bias from the Fisher discriminant,  {\\mathcalF_{ {IP}}} , is investigated using a pre-selected sample, with only the track and vertex quality cuts applied.  The distributions of  {\\mathcalF_{ {IP}}}  for  { {\\Lambda} } ,  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } }  and  { { K } ^0_{   S}}  in data and Monte Carlo simulation are estimated using sideband subtraction.  The double ratios of data/MC efficiencies are seen to be independent of the discriminant, implying that the distribution is well modelled in the simulation.  No systematic uncertainty is assigned to this selection requirement.\n",
    "A degradation is observed of the reconstructed impact parameter resolution in data compared to simulation.  The simulated  { V ^0}   impact parameters are recalculated with smeared primary and secondary vertex positions to match the resolution measured in data.  There is a negligible effect on the  { V ^0}   ratio results.\n",
    "A good estimate of the reconstructed yields and their uncertainties in both data and simulation is provided by the fitting procedure but there may be a residual systematic uncertainty from the choice of this method.  Comparisons are made using side-band subtraction and the resulting  { V ^0}   yields are in agreement with the results of the fits at the 0.1 \\% level.  The resulting absolute uncertainties on the ratios are on the order of 0.001.\n",
    "Simulated events are weighted to improve agreement between simulated  { V ^0}   kinematic distributions and data.  As described in Section~\\ref{sec:analysis}, these weights are calculated from a two-dimensional fit, linear in both  {p_T}  and  y , to the distribution of the ratio between reconstructed data and simulated Monte Carlo candidates.  This choice of parametrisation could be a source of systematic uncertainty, therefore alternative procedures are investigated including a two-dimensional polynomial fit to 3^{ {rd}} order in both  {p_T}  and  y  and a (non-parametric) bilinear interpolation.  The results from each method are compared across the measurement range to estimate typical systematic uncertainties of 0.01-0.05 for  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { {\\Lambda} }  and <0.03 for  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { { K } ^0_{   S}} .\n",
    "The lifetime distributions of reconstructed and selected  { V ^0}   candidates are consistent between data and simulation.  The possible influence of transverse  { {\\Lambda} }  ( {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } ) polarisation was explored by simulations with extreme values of polarisation and found to produce no significant effect on the measured ratios. Potential acceptance effects were checked as a function of azimuthal angle, with no evidence of systematic bias.  The potential sources of systematic uncertainty or bias are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:syst-summary}. \n",

According to Monte Carlo studies, as discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:systematics}, the requirement for a reconstructed primary vertex results in only a small contribution from diffractive events to the selected  { V ^0}   sample, therefore non-diffractive simulated events are used for these comparisons. The predictions of LHCb MC and Perugia 0 are similar throughout.  The ratio  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { {\\Lambda} }  is close to Perugia 0 at low  y  but becomes smaller with higher rapidity, approaching Perugia NOCR.  In collisions at  { s }  = 7 {  {TeV}}, this ratio is consistent with Perugia 0 across the measured  {p_T}  range but is closer to Perugia NOCR at  { s }  = 0.9 {  {TeV}}.

    "\\section{Conclusions}\n",
    "The ratio  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { {\\Lambda} }  is a measurement of the transport of baryon number from  { {p-p}} collisions to final state hadrons.  There is good agreement with Perugia 0 at low rapidity which is to be expected since the past experimental results used to test this model have focused on that rapidity region.  At high rapidity however, the measurements favour the extreme baryon transport model of Perugia NOCR.  The measured ratio  {\\overline  { {\\Lambda} } } / { { K } ^0_{   S}}  is significantly larger than predicted by Perugia 0,  {  i.e.} relatively more baryons are produced in strange hadronisation in data than expected, particularly at higher  {p_T} .  Similar results are found at both  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {  {TeV}}.\n",
    "When plotted as a function of rapidity loss,  {\\Delta y} , there is excellent agreement between the measurements of both ratios at  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {  {TeV}} as well as with STAR 's results published at 0.2 {  {TeV}}.  The broad coverage of the measurements in  {\\Delta y}  provides a unique data set, which is complementary to previous results.  The  { V ^0}   production ratios presented in this paper will help the development of hadronisation models to improve the predictions of Standard Model physics at the LHC  which will define the baseline for new discoveries.  \n",

      "While the underlying interactions of hadronic collisions and hadronisation are understood within the Standard Model, exact computation of the processes governed by QCD are difficult due to the highly non-linear nature of the strong force.  In the absence of full calculations, generators based on phenomenological models have been devised and optimised, or ``tuned'', to accurately reproduce experimental observations.  These generators predict how Standard Model physics will behave at the LHC  and constitute the reference for discoveries of New Physics effects.  \n",
      "Strange quark production is a powerful probe for hadronisation processes at  {p-p} colliders since protons have no net strangeness.  Recent experimental results in the field have been published by STAR ~\\cite{STAR} from RHIC   {p-p} collisions at  { s }  = 0.2 {TeV} and by ALICE ~\\cite{ALICE}, CMS ~\\cite{CMS} and LHCb ~\\cite{KsCrossSection} from LHC   {p-p} collisions at  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {TeV}.  LHCb  can make an important contribution thanks to a full instrumentation of the detector in the forward region that is unique among the LHC  experiments.  Studies of data recorded at different energies with the same apparatus help to control the experimental systematic uncertainties.  \n",

      "\\label{sec:detector}\n",
      "The Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment (LHCb) at CERN is a single-arm spectrometer covering the forward rapidity region.  The analysis presented in this paper relies exclusively on the tracking detectors.  The high precision tracking system begins with a silicon strip Vertex Locator (VELO), designed to identify displaced secondary vertices up to about 65 {   cm}  downstream of the nominal interaction point.  A large area silicon tracker follows upstream of a dipole magnet and tracker stations, built with a mixture of straw tube and silicon strip detectors, are located downstream.  The LHCb  coordinate system is defined to be right-handed with its origin at the nominal interaction point, the z axis aligned along the beam line towards the magnet and the y axis pointing upwards.  The bending plane is horizontal and the magnet has a reversible field, with the positive B_y polarity called ``up'' and the negative ``down''.  Tracks reconstructed through the full spectrometer experience an integrated magnetic field of around 4 Tm.  The detector is described in full elsewhere \\cite{DetectorPaper}.\n",
      "A loose minimum bias trigger is used for this analysis, requiring at least one track segment in the downstream tracking stations.  This trigger is more than 99 \\% efficient for offline selected events that contain at least two tracks reconstructed through the full system.\n",
      "Complementary data sets were recorded at two collision energies of  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {TeV}, with both polarities of the dipole magnet.  An integrated luminosity of  {0.3  {nb}^{-1}}  (corresponding to 12.5 million triggers) was taken at the lower energy, of which 48 \\% had the up  magnetic field configuration.  At the higher energy, 67 \\% of a total  {1.8  {nb}^{-1}}  (110.3 million triggers) was taken with field up .\n",
      "At injection energy ( { {\\sqrts}  = 0.9  { Te  -0.1em V} } ), the proton beams are significantly broadened spatially compared to the accelerated beams at  { {\\sqrts}  = 7  { Te  -0.1em V} } .  To protect the detector, the two halves of the VELO are retracted along the x axis from their nominal position of inner radius of 8 {   mm}  to the beam, out to 18 {   mm} , which results in a reduction of the detector acceptance at small angles to the beam axis by approximately 0.5 units of rapidity.\n",
      "The beams collide with a crossing angle in the horizontal plane tuned to compensate for LHCb 's magnetic field.  The angle required varies as a function of beam configuration and for the data taking period covered by this study was set to 2.1 {   mrad}  at  { {\\sqrts}  = 0.9  { Te  -0.1em V} }  and 270 { \\textmu rad}  at 7 {TeV}.  Throughout this analysis  { V ^0}   momenta and any derived quantity such as rapidity are computed in the centre-of-mass frame of the colliding protons.\n",
      "Samples of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events have been produced in close approximation to the data-taking conditions described above for estimation of efficiencies and systematic uncertainties.  A total of 73 million simulated minimum bias events were used for this analysis per magnet polarity at  { {\\sqrts}  = 0.9  { Te  -0.1em V} }  and 60 (69) million events at 7 {TeV} for field up  (down ).  LHCb  MC simulations are described in Ref.~\\cite{Gauss}, with  {p-p} collisions generated by  {Pythia}  6 \\cite{PYTHIA6}.  Emerging particles decay via  {EvtGen}  \\cite{EvtGen}, with final state radiation handled by  {Photos}  \\cite{PHOTOS}.  The resulting particles are transported through LHCb  by  {Geant}  \\cite{Geant}, which models hits on the sensitive elements of the detector as well as interactions between the particles and the detector material.  Secondary particles produced in these material interactions decay via  {Geant} .\n",
      "Additional samples of five million minimum bias events were generated for studies of systematic uncertainties using  {Pythia}  6 variants Perugia 0 (tuned on experimental results from SPS, LEP and Tevatron) and Perugia NOCR (an extreme model of baryon transport) \\cite{Peter}.  Similarly sized samples of  {Pythia}  8 \\cite{PYTHIA8} minimum bias diffractive events were also generated, including both hard and soft diffraction \\footnote{Single- and double-diffractive process types are considered: 92--94 in  {Pythia}  6.421, with soft diffraction, and 103--105 in  {Pythia}  8.130, with soft and hard diffraction.} \\cite{Navin}.\n",

      "Both measured ratios are compared to the predictions of the  {Pythia}  6 generator tunes: LHCb MC, Perugia 0 and Perugia NOCR, as functions of  {p_T}  and  y  at  { s }  = 0.9 {TeV} (Fig.~\\ref{fig:plotDataTheory-900}) and at  { s }  = 7 {TeV} (Fig.~\\ref{fig:plotDataTheory-7}). According to Monte Carlo studies, as discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:systematics}, the requirement for a reconstructed primary vertex results in only a small contribution from diffractive events to the selected  { V ^0}   sample, therefore non-diffractive simulated events are used for these comparisons. The predictions of LHCb MC and Perugia 0 are similar throughout.  The ratio  {\\overline  {\\Lambda} } / {\\Lambda}  is close to Perugia 0 at low  y  but becomes smaller with higher rapidity, approaching Perugia NOCR.  In collisions at  { s }  = 7 {TeV}, this ratio is consistent with Perugia 0 across the measured  {p_T}  range but is closer to Perugia NOCR at  { s }  = 0.9 {TeV}.  The production ratio   {\\overline  {\\Lambda} } / { { K } ^0_{   S}}  is larger in data than predicted by Perugia 0 at both collision energies and in all measurement bins, with the most significant differences observed at high  {p_T} .\n",
      "To compare results at both collision energies, and to probe scaling violation, both production ratios are shown as a function of rapidity loss,  {\\Delta y}  = y_{beam} - y, in Fig.~\\ref{fig:plotDeltaY}, where y_{beam} is the rapidity of the protons in the anti-clockwise LHC  beam, which travels along the positive z direction through the detector.  Excellent agreement is observed between results at both  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {TeV} as well as with results from STAR  at  { s }  = 0.2 {TeV}.  The measured ratios are also consistent with results published by ALICE ~\\cite{ALICE} and CMS ~\\cite{CMS}.\n",

      "\\section{Conclusions}\n",
      "The ratio  {\\overline  {\\Lambda} } / {\\Lambda}  is a measurement of the transport of baryon number from  {p-p} collisions to final state hadrons.  There is good agreement with Perugia 0 at low rapidity which is to be expected since the past experimental results used to test this model have focused on that rapidity region.  At high rapidity however, the measurements favour the extreme baryon transport model of Perugia NOCR.  The measured ratio  {\\overline  {\\Lambda} } / { { K } ^0_{   S}}  is significantly larger than predicted by Perugia 0,  {  i.e.} relatively more baryons are produced in strange hadronisation in data than expected, particularly at higher  {p_T} .  Similar results are found at both  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {TeV}.\n",
      "When plotted as a function of rapidity loss,  {\\Delta y} , there is excellent agreement between the measurements of both ratios at  { s }  = 0.9 and 7 {TeV} as well as with STAR 's results published at 0.2 {TeV}.  The broad coverage of the measurements in  {\\Delta y}  provides a unique data set, which is complementary to previous results.  The  { V ^0}   production ratios presented in this paper will help the development of hadronisation models to improve the predictions of Standard Model physics at the LHC  which will define the baseline for new discoveries.  \n",
